Predicting the product life cycle of songs on radio

This research strives to predict the remaining product
life cycle of a song on radio after it has been played for one or two
months. The best results were achieved using a k-d tree to calculate the
most similar songs to the test songs and use a Random Forest model to
forecast radio plays. An 82,78% and 83,44% accuracy is achieved for
the two time periods, respectively. This explorative research leads to
over 4500 test metrics to find the best combination of models and preprocessing
techniques. Other algorithms tested are KNN, MLP and
CNN. The features only consist of daily radio plays and use no musical
features.
